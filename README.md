# Readkey Reader

For now, it's a pixel-level copy of [Reeder for Mac](http://reederapp.com/mac/) for learning purposes.

## Credits

Besides common libraries like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
here are some libraries I used either for testing or production.

- [lorem-cn](https://github.com/webzhao/lorem-cn) as a random Chinese generator.
- [jQuery.Keyframes](https://github.com/Keyframes/jQuery.Keyframes) for dynamic generation of CSS3 keyframes.
- [prefixfree](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/) for avoiding manually prefixing CSS properties.
