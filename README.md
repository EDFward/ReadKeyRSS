# ReadkeyRSS Reader

For now, it's a pixel-level copy of [Reeder for Mac](http://reederapp.com/mac/) for learning purposes, developed using ES6.

## Introduction
The basic functionalities include:

- Subscribe to a feed source (RSS/Atom) and start receiving latest feeds.
- Find every feed's keywords without reading its content. ([ReadKeyWord](https://github.com/EDFward/ReadKeyWord))
- Mark feeds as read.

For details of the backend server, check [ReadKeyServer repo](https://github.com/EDFward/ReadKeyServer).

## Credits

Besides common libraries like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
here are some libraries I used either for testing or production.

- [lorem-cn](https://github.com/webzhao/lorem-cn) as a random Chinese generator.
- [jQuery.Keyframes](https://github.com/Keyframes/jQuery.Keyframes) for dynamic generation of CSS3 keyframes.
- [prefixfree](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/) for avoiding manually prefixing CSS properties.
